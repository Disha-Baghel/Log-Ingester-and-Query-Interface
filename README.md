# Log-Ingester-and-Query-Interface
This project involves the development of a versatile log ingestor system capable of efficiently managing extensive log data through HTTP ingestion on port 3000. The log ingestor will focus on optimized data handling and storage, accommodating large volumes of logs from various sources. Additionally, a user-friendly query interface will be implemented, offering both full-text search and specific field filters for seamless log data analysis. The choice of programming language and technology stack will prioritize performance and ease of development, ensuring scalability and flexibility. This project aims to provide a robust solution for log management, enabling users to easily ingest, store, and query logs effectively.
